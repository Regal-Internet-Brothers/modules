modules
=======

**This repository contains all of the (Public) modules I've written in Monkey which I have deemed stable. These modules have been properly integrated into my projects. (In these modules or otherwise)**
**This repository contains the (Public) modules of mine that I've deemed stable, not necessarily all of my public modules.**

***All functionality is 'as-is', so some things may not work as expected. That being said, I actively use these modules, so if a module makes it here, I've deemed it suitable for public use. (For the most part, you shouldn't have any issues)***

The current work-flow for the release of these modules is to create a seemingly stable version, create a trial repository, then eventually get the module stable enough to be adopted into this repository.

Some of my modules aren't hosted on GitHub, those modules could be in several places, but they're most likely on BitBucket: https://bitbucket.org/ImmutableOctet

A bit of clarification on my intents by releasing my source code:

I have written a number of modules for private use. These modules may never see the light of day publicly, however, these modules will NOT be a requirement to use the modules in this repository. (Though, they may act as optional extensions to these modules)
I'm generally one for the "Open Source" mindset, but some things aren't in good enough condition to release. But, what I do release is done with the understanding that the source is released for the sake of education, redistribution, as well as modification under other circumstances.
Code available here is written with a specific design and work-flow. I will not accept pull requests which do not adhere to my standards of conduct. I will, however, take pull requests as a basis for a change I'll manage myself.
I write code I find standard and in some ways elegant, and I will not have inconsistency without valid reason. I am open to the modification, redistribution, and analysis of my software, however, these are not community-driven modules, they're "Open Source" modules.
Any pull requests made about these modules should act as rough drafts, not final source code. *If I agree with a change, I will refactor the code in the pull request as I see fit.*

I personally don't believe in portions of public projects being maintained by multiple people. I only think this would work in isolated/abstracted situations such as individually developed modules (Each with their own creator).
For this reason, I will likely not adopt exact source code from pull requests.

*Basically all of my public source code is released under the MIT license, so you can do with it as you please.*

***All of my public source code is either going to be used, or is currently in use in commercial or private applications.***

**This repository was released on May 17th, 2014, and was released [alongside this forum post](http://www.monkey-x.com/Community/posts.php?topic=8506&post=93769).**
